                    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                    <p>Team 7, consisting of members Joshua Chuah and Esther Chan, decided to take on the task of creating a website for upcoming K-Pop girl group (G)I-DLE.
                    <br>
                    We wanted to create a beautiful, responsive, and accesible fanpage. As (G)I-DLE's influence grows, the demand for a centralized location for fans to learn more about the band grows with it. Hence, we designed a page that features all the essentials:</p>
                    <ul class="list_features">
                        <li>Biography</li>
                        <li>Concert tickets</li>
                        <li>Links to their music</li>
                        <li>Official Merchandise</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="about_col">
                    <img src="images/candid.jpg" alt="Candid shot of the band">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="final_remarks">
                <h1>Team 7: Final Remarks</h1>
                <p>As this website is still under construction, we acknowledge that there is still a lot left to do. For the final project, we plan to centralize the interface, ensure that all links are working, and improve on the responsiveness and accessibility of the page. That includes collapsing the navbar, providing suitable alt text for all images, using ARIA landmarks, and proper headings.
                <br>
                We are very proud of our work, and would love to hear from you on how to make the website better. Please feel free to leave us feedback.<br><br>Thank you!</p>
